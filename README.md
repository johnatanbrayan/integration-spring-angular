## ðŸš€ Why Monolithic Architecture
If you have full-stack developers that will be working on both sides of the application a monolithic approach could make sense. If you have separate teams working on the frontend and backend splitting these projects into two independent projects might make sense. There are pros and cons to each and these should really be evaluated on a per-project basis.

Having a single deployable asset simplifies the deployment process which I know a lot of developers don't like to deal with. If you're a single developer or a team of full-stack developers this is a great option. There are some tricks to getting this all into a single project but that is exactly what you will test in this project.
